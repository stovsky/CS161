1. No, the instance with 3 colors is not satisfiable.
2. Yes, the instance with 4 colors is satisfiable.
3. The answers tell me that there is no solution to the graph coloring problem with 3 colors, but there is a solution with 4 colors.

The results of RSAT are:
-1 -2 -3 4 -5 -6 7 -8 -9 10 -11 -12 -13 -14 15 -16 17 -18 -19 -20 -21 22 -23 -24 25 -26 -27 -28

This means that, if we have the colors (red, green, yellow, blue), a solution is as follows:

Node 1: Red
Node 2: Green
Node 3: Yellow
Node 4: Green
Node 5: Blue
Node 6: Yellow
Node 7: Blue


4. I attemped the problem using 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 colors. They were all unsatisfiable.
Finally, I found a solution for 8 colors.  Thus, the minimum number of colors required to properly color graph2.txt is 8.
